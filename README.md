<div align="center"><h1><title_name>Why Reloaded?</title_name></div>

The older one version for 1.12.2 and 1.14-1.18 had a lot of beginner-like code and the whole codebase was quietly... not satisfying me at all. This version also was required some parts of the code being rewritten due to a changes when it comes to porting to 1.19+.

And now. After 3 years of learning different kind of stuff, I'm glad to announce the rewritten version to support up to 4 modloaders and several versions simultaneously. I have switched to Architectury instead of creating mods only for the Minecraft Forge because I don't feel that supporting Forge only would make sense after NeoForge being announced. 

The Reloaded version supports MC versions higher than 1.19.2 and should work just fine on Forge/Fabric/Quilt/NeoForge ecosystems.

If you still want to see source code for the older Forge-only version, [go here](https://github.com/DenisMasterHerobrine/TravellersBoots). This version won't be updated nor supported in any way.
